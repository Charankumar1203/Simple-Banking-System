# Simple-Banking-System
#### An user-interactive Banking solution for a Bank having 10 ATMs in a city written in C++ and a pure console application that can be acccessed via the command line.

To use the application, just type 'make' and press enter in the terminal by changing your working directory to 'SimpleBankingSolution' after cloning the repo to your machine. This will compile all the files and generates you an executable 'BankingSolution' which can be run directly from the terminal (by typing ./BankingSolution in the terminal).
